      <h1>Assignment</h1>
      <p>For this assignment, each group was tasked with conducting a small-scale usability test on popular language learning apps. My group chose to test the app Duolingo.</p>
<p>Usability refers to how easy something is to use. It has 5 key components which are illustrated here. Click the photo for more information.

<h1>Selection</h1>
<p>Participants were selected from group membersâ€™ personal connections. Participants ranged in age from 17-63 and there was an equal amount of males and females. There was also an equal mix of platforms, with four users testing the Android app and four users testing the IOS app.</p>
	<h1>Method</h1>
<p>Participants were timed and evaluated on eight pre-determined tasks related to the usability of the app. After completing the tasks, participants answered satisfaction questions about their experience and ranked the overall usability of the app. </p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
<p>The task completion rate was 100% for all eight tasks. Overall, the tasks that took longer to complete also had the highest number of errors and the tasks that took the shortest amount of time had the least number of errors. For difficulty, participants were asked to rank the tasks from 1-5 with 1 being super easy and 5 being super hard. The average of all tasks was ranked fairly easy at 1.9. For satisfaction, participants used a 1-7 scale with 1 for strongly disagree, 7 for strongly agree and 4 meaning neutral to answer satisfaction questions. Overall, the participants varied in their satisfaction with the average per participant ranging from 3.95 to 6.42. </p>
